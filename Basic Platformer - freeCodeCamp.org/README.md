# Basic Platformer

A basic platformer game where the player controls a Fox and must dodge the frogs in order not to die. This game was initially built following the tutorial from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg), although I've taken the liberty to add features of my own in order to learn more about Godot (these features are listed below).
